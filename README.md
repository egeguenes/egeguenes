👋 Hi, I’m Ege Güneş
👀 I’m passionate about programming, mathematics, cybersecurity, and collaborating with other developers to build innovative projects. I enjoy diving into challenging problems and creating solutions that make an impact.

🌱 I’m deeply interested in full-stack development and have been exploring Swift for building robust applications. I’ve also been working with C to deepen my understanding of operating systems and low-level programming. Additionally i build some small programms using Python and Java, with a focus on improving my coding practices and understanding advanced concepts. 

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on projects involving cryptography adaptations in Python and Java. I believe working on such implementations will not only strengthen my coding skills but also deepen my understanding of cryptographic principles. I’m open to contributing to open-source projects or teaming up with like-minded developers to create something meaningful.

📫 You can reach me me via email at guenes.ege@gmail.com. I’m always excited to discuss new ideas, collaborate on projects, or simply connect with fellow developers.

Looking forward to building something amazing together! 🚀
